    "lyrics": "1\nO worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness,\nBow down before Him, His glory proclaim;\nWith gold of obedience, and incense of lowliness,\nKneel and adore Him: the Lord is His name.\n\n2\nLow at His feet lay thy burden of carefulness,\nHigh on His heart He will bear it for thee,\nComfort thy sorrows, and answer thy prayerfulness,\nGuiding thy steps as may best for thee be.\n\n3\nFear not to enter His courts in the slenderness\nOf the poor wealth thou wouldst reckon as thine;\nTruth in its beauty, and love in its tenderness,\nThese are the offerings to lay on His shrine.\n\n4\nThese, though we bring them in trembling and fearfulness,\nHe will accept for the name that is dear;\nMornings of joy give for evenings of tearfulness,\nTrust for our trembling, and hope for our fear."

    "lyrics": "1\nThe Lord in Zion reigneth, let all the world rejoice, \nAnd come before His throne of grace with tuneful heart and voice; \nThe Lord in Zion reigneth, and there His praise shall ring, \nTo Him shall princes bend the knee and kings their glory bring. \n\n2 \nThe Lord in Zion reigneth, and who so great as He? \nThe depths of earth are in His hands; He rules the mighty sea. \nO crown His Name with honor, and let His standard wave, \nTill distant isles beyond the deep shall own His power to save. \n\n3 \nThe Lord in Zion reigneth, these hours to Him belong; \nO enter now His temple gates, and fill His courts with song; \nBeneath His royal banner let every creature fall, \nExalt the King of heaven and earth, and crown Him Lord of all."
