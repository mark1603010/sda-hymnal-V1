and for her young provides a nest,
but will my God to them alone
pour out his mercy from the throne?
Blest are the saints who dwell on high
around your throne, above the sky;
their brightest glories shine above,
and all their work is praise and love.
3 Great God, attend, while Zion sings
the joy that from your presence springs;
to spend a day within your courts
exceeds a thousand days apart.
You are our sun, you bless our day;
and you our shield, to guard our way
from all assaults of hell and sin,
from foes without and fears within.

and crown that grace with glory too;
you give all things, and you withhold
no heav'nly good from upright souls.
